        <p class="subheading">Potential Reuse</p>

        <p class="content">Please describe any communities that might be interested in this dataset.  These could be broad (e.g. “researchers) or niche (“quantitative social scientists from the university of Michigan). Also describe the ways in which your data could be reused by these communities. This might for example include aggregation, further analysis, reference, validation, teaching or collaboration.</p>

        <p class="subheading">Significant Properties</p>

        <p class="content">For each of the potential reuses you’ve described, please describe the significant properties of the dataset. What characteristics, functionalities, or formats are key to supporting reuse?</p>

        <p class="subheading">Curation to Date</p>

        <p class="content">Describe and critique any preservation or curation actions that have been applied to this dataset to date.  Is this dataset well curated?  Or minimally curated?  What risk factors might it face?</p>

        <p class="subheading">Threats to File Formats</p>

        <p class="content">Evaluate the risks associated with each file format used by this dataset (the Library of Congress Digital Preservation Site provides detailed information about the sustainability of many formats: https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats).</p>

        <p class="content">Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each format for long-term storage of the content type you chose.  Be sure to consider threats according to the following risk categories we discussed in class (Disclosure, Adoption, Transparency, Self-Documentation, External Dependencies, Impact of Patents, and Technical Protection Mechanisms).</p>

        <p class="subheading">Recommendations for Further Curation</p>

        <p class="content">Based on your assessment, make a recommendation for which formats are suitable for long-term storage, and which should be migrated to more stable formats. </p>

        <p class="content">Additionally propose other at least three other forms of curation that this dataset may benefit from. Explain the reason/rationale for your recommendation. Draw on readings from class as appropriate.  Consider who might want to use this dataset, and what properties they consider most significant about each file.</p>

        <p class="heading" id="references">References</p>
